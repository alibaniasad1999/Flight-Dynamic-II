We assume that $C_{L_{wb}}$ have linear behavior between $-1.5^{\circ}$ and $8^{\circ}$.


At $(-1.5)$ degree $C_{L_{wb}}$ is $0$ and at $5$ degree $C_{L_{wb}}$ is 0.52.
$$\dfrac{\Delta C_{L_{wb}}}{\Delta \alpha} = C_{L_{\alpha_{wb}}}\to C_{L_{\alpha_{wb}}} = \dfrac{0.52 - 0.0}{5 - (-1.5)} = 0.08$$
$$
C_{L_{0_{wb}}} = 0.08 \times 1.5 = 0.12
$$
\begin{equation}
C_{L_{wb}}= C_{L_{0_{wb}}}+C_{L_{\alpha_{wb}}}\alpha = 0.12 + 0.08\alpha
\label{eq_clalpha}
\end{equation}
From equation \ref{eq_clalpha} at $1$ degree angle of attack $C_{L_{wb}} = 0.2$ and at $7.88$ degree angle of attack $C_{L_{wb}} = 0.75$.
\begin{equation}
C_m = C_{m_0} + C_{m_\alpha}\alpha
\label{eq_cm}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
C_{m_0} = C_{m_{ac_{wb}}} + C_{L_{0_{wb}}}(\bar x_{cg} - \bar x_{ac_{wb}})
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
C_{m_\alpha} = C_{L_{\alpha_{wb}}}(\bar x_{cg} - \bar x_{ac_{wb}})
\end{equation}


\begin{equation}
C_{m_{wb}} = (C_{m_{ac_{wb}}} + C_{L_{0_{wb}}}(\bar x_{cg} - \bar x_{ac_{wb}})) +
C_{L_{\alpha_{wb}}}(\bar x_{cg} - \bar x_{ac_{wb}})
\label{eq_cm}
\end{equation}


From equation \ref{eq_cm}:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item at $1$ degree angle of attack:
    $$-0.01 = C_{m_{ac_{wb}}}  + 0.2 (0.35-\bar x_{ac_{wb}}) $$
    \item at $7.88$ degree angle of attack:
    $$0.05 =C_{m_{ac_{wb}}} +  0.75(0.35-\bar x_{ac_{wb}}) $$
\end{enumerate}
There is 2 equations and 2 unknowns.

Answers:
$$x_{ac_{wb}} = 0.24c,\quad C_{m_{ac_{wb}}} = -0.032$$
